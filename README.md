# WeatherApp

## Overview
WeatherApp is a SwiftUI-based iOS application that allows users to search for any location and view the current weather conditions in real-time. The app is designed using the MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator) architecture, ensuring a clean and scalable structure.

## Features
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for cities to view current weather conditions.
- **Weather Information**: Displays details such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
- **Error Handling**: Alerts the user in case of any data fetch errors.
- **Coordinator Pattern**: Manages view navigation cleanly and efficiently.
- **MVVM-C Architecture**: Separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and navigation.
